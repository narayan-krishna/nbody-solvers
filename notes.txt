n-body solver: planet/star motion

- prompt: simulate the positions and velocities of a collection of interacting bodies

inputs: mass, position, and velocity of particles
outputs: position and velocity of particles at specified time-steps

particle id -> int
  (particle id will be used to index vectors)

mass -> vector (m)
position -> vector(x, y)
velocity -> vector(x, y)
force -> vector(x, y)

- force on a particle is the sum of the forces from other particles onto said particle
- f=ma
- solver for acceleration
- use differentiation to solve for position, velocity
