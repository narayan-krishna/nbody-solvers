n-body solver: planet/star motion

- prompt: simulate the positions and velocities of a collection of interacting bodies

inputs: mass, position, and velocity of particles
outputs: position and velocity of particles at specified time-steps

particle id -> int
  (particle id will be used to index vectors)

mass(m) -> mass of particle[i]
position(x,y) -> x, y coordinates of particle
velocity(x,y) -> velocity 

force(x,y) -> force onto a particle[i] in the x direction, y direction

- force on a particle is the sum of the forces from other particles onto said particle
- f=ma
- solver for acceleration
- use differentiation to solve for position, velocity
